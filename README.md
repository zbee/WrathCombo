    It's a heavily enhanced version of the XIVCombo plugin, offering highly 
    customisable features and options to allow users to have their

    button; for PvE, PvP, and more.
    <br><br>
    Wrath Combo is regularly updated to include new features and to keep
    up-to-date with the latest job changes in Final Fantasy XIV.
